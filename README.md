# singr

A singularity image including:

- R version 3.6.2
- geospatial system deps gdal and geos
- aws cli

## using with an R package on the CCHMC HPC

#### transfer to HPC

- use `renv::snapshot()` locally to snapshot project dependencies
- copy project folder to HPC home folder
    - *don't forget to copy all files, even dotfiles, `.Rprofile` generated by `renv` needs to be there to ensure private package library is used*
    - making sure that an `renv` project is present is important! without it, the R process in the container will try to use the host R package library (`.libPaths()`) and will cause all kinds of problems
    - an advantage of this is that the project library compiled specifically for the container OS will be stored locally, meaning that the packages will be already installed the next time the container is used
    - sidenote: if you want to run the container without an `renv` project setup, just setup an empty project first by running `renv::init()` from R on the host
- make sure the `.sif` file is present in home folder
    - either copy from a build of https://github.com/cole-brokamp/singr
    - or pull the latest version from singularity hub with `singularity pull library://cole-brokamp/default/singr`
    - or pull a specific version of R from singularity hub with `singularity pull library://cole-brokamp/default/singr:3.6.2`
- note that the name of the downloaded `.sif` file will be different depending on which method used above; we will use the file name `singr_latest.sif` assuming that the latest version was pulled from singularity hub
- setup any system environment variables if needed (e.g., `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)

#### start an interactive R session

change to the project directory and run:

```sh
# request interactive job:
bsub -Is -W 10:00 -n 16 -M 250000 -R "span[ptile=16]" /bin/bash

# optional: use tmux to create a detachable prompt

# turn on internet by interactively entering cchmc username and password with:
proxy_on

# start singularity image by calling the container as if it were an executable
module load singularity/3.1.0
~/singr_latest.sif
```

this will open up an interactive R prompt and automatically install the necessary version of `renv`

next, bootstrap the library as defined in the lockfile by running `renv::restore()` within R

check resources available to R with:

```R
parallel::detectCores()
benchmarkme::get_ram()
benchmarkme::get_cup()
```

#### run a batch R job

...

## notes

- tmux works from login node to attach to session started on a compute node (leave your job and come back later without having to find the ip address of the compute node)
- singularity imports all system environment variables (github/aws keys, etc)
- singularity automatically mounts `$HOME`, `$PWD`, and `/tmp`
- `renv::restore()` will install packages to project-specific library *but* these are actually symmlinks to `renv`'s cache folder within `$HOME`; this means that restoring a new project will link to this cache instead of reinstalling any R packages from source
